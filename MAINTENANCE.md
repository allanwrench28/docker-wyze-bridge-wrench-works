2. **Be Responsive**: Address issues and PRs promptly
3. **Document Well**: Keep documentation accurate and helpful
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate changes before release
5. **Communicate Clearly**: Keep users informed of changes

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

## Syncing with Upstream

### Checking for Updates

```bash
# Add upstream if not already added
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge.git

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Check what's new
git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline

# View detailed changes
git log HEAD..upstream/main --graph --decorate
```

### Merging Upstream Changes

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them carefully
# Test thoroughly after merging

# Push to origin
git push origin main
```

### After Syncing

1. **Update version references** in documentation if upstream version changed
2. **Test Docker builds** to ensure no breaking changes
3. **Review changelog** and update CHANGELOG.md with fork-specific notes
4. **Test with real cameras** if possible
5. **Update README.md** if new features or cameras are supported
6. **Create a release** if significant changes were merged

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

- Follow upstream version numbers for synced releases
- Use `-wrench.X` suffix for fork-specific releases
  - Example: `v2.10.3-wrench.1` for first fork-specific patch on v2.10.3

### Creating a Release

1. **Ensure all tests pass**
   ```bash
   # Build Docker image
   docker build -t wyze-bridge:test -f docker/Dockerfile .
   
   # Test with your cameras
   # Verify WebUI loads
   # Check streams work
   ```

2. **Update documentation**
   - Update version numbers in README.md
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
   - Update app/.env if version changed

3. **Create git tag**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v2.10.3 -m "Release v2.10.3 - Synced with upstream"
   git push origin v2.10.3
   ```

4. **Create GitHub release**
   - Go to GitHub Releases
   - Create release from tag
   - Copy changelog content
   - Highlight fork-specific changes if any

5. **Monitor for issues**
   - Watch for issues after release
   - Be ready to hotfix critical bugs
   - Communicate with users about any problems

## Issue Management

### Triaging Issues

1. **Determine if upstream issue**: Check if issue exists upstream
   - If yes, link to upstream issue and monitor it
   - If fixed upstream, sync the fix

2. **Categorize issues**:
   - `bug`: Something isn't working
   - `enhancement`: Feature request
   - `documentation`: Documentation improvements
   - `question`: Support questions
   - `upstream`: Waiting on upstream fix
   - `help-wanted`: Good for community contributions

3. **Set priority**:
   - `critical`: Security issues, data loss, major breakage
   - `high`: Significant functionality broken
   - `medium`: Important but workarounds exist
   - `low`: Minor issues, enhancements

4. **Initial response time goal**: Within 48 hours

### Closing Issues

- Verify fix before closing
- Provide clear explanation
- Reference commits/PRs that fixed it
- Ask reporter to verify if possible
