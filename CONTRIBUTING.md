- Address community issues promptly
- Improve documentation and user experience
- Test and validate new camera models
- Provide additional features when beneficial

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:

1. **Check upstream first**: Many issues may already be addressed in the [upstream repository](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/issues)
2. **Search existing issues**: Check if your issue has already been reported
3. **Provide details**: Include your camera model, firmware version, Docker environment, and logs

When reporting an issue, include:
- Camera model and firmware version
- Docker/Home Assistant version
- Complete error messages and logs
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Your configuration (sanitized of sensitive data)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for:
- Documentation improvements
- New camera model support
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- User experience improvements

Please open an issue to discuss major changes before implementing them.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Keep changes focused**: One feature or fix per pull request
3. **Test your changes**: Ensure your changes work with various camera models
4. **Update documentation**: Reflect your changes in README.md or other docs
5. **Follow code style**: Match the existing code style in the project
6. **Write clear commit messages**: Explain what and why, not just what

#### Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - [Download](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Python 3.7+** - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip** (Python package manager, usually included with Python)

**Check if you have the prerequisites:**
```bash
git --version
docker --version
docker-compose --version
python3 --version  # or 'python --version' on Windows
pip3 --version     # or 'pip --version' on Windows
```

**Where to run these commands:**
- **Windows:** Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash - NOT Python IDLE
- **Mac:** Terminal app
- **Linux:** Any terminal emulator

**Setup steps:**

```bash
# Step 1: Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docker-wyze-bridge-wrench-works.git
cd docker-wyze-bridge-wrench-works

# Step 2: Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge.git

# Step 3: Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Step 4: Install Python dependencies
cd app

# On Linux/Mac:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# On Windows:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Return to root directory
cd ..
```

**What each tool does:**
- **Git** - Version control, for downloading and managing code
- **Docker** - Container platform, for running the bridge application
- **Python** - Programming language, for running/developing the Python code
- **pip** - Python package installer, for installing dependencies

#### Testing Your Changes

**Where to run these commands:**
- **Windows:** Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash
- **Mac:** Terminal app
- **Linux:** Terminal emulator

**Testing steps:**

1. **Build the Docker image** locally:
   ```bash
   # Run from the repository root directory
   docker build -t wyze-bridge:test -f docker/Dockerfile .
   ```
   
   **What this does:** Builds a Docker container image with your changes

2. **Run with your cameras**:
   ```bash
   # Replace with your actual Wyze credentials
   docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 \
     -e WYZE_EMAIL=your@email.com \
     -e WYZE_PASSWORD=yourpass \
     -e API_ID=your-api-id \
     -e API_KEY=your-api-key \
     wyze-bridge:test
   ```
   
   **What this does:** Starts the bridge container with your changes
   
   **Access the Web UI:** Open `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser

3. **Verify streams** work for affected cameras:
   - Check the Web UI to see if cameras are discovered
   - Test RTSP stream in VLC: `rtsp://localhost:8554/camera-name`

4. **Check logs** for any errors or warnings:
   ```bash
   # Logs are shown in the terminal where you ran 'docker run'
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop the container
   ```

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Documentation

When updating documentation:
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Update table of contents if adding sections
- Test any code examples you provide

## Relationship with Upstream

This fork maintains close alignment with the upstream repository:

- We regularly sync with upstream releases
- Major features should ideally be contributed to upstream first
- Fork-specific features are clearly documented as such
- We avoid diverging from upstream architecture when possible

### Syncing with Upstream

Contributors can help keep the fork updated.

**Where to run these commands:**
- **Windows:** Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash
- **Mac:** Terminal app
- **Linux:** Terminal emulator

**Sync steps:**

```bash
# Step 1: Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Step 2: Merge upstream main into your branch
git merge upstream/main

# Step 3: If there are conflicts, Git will tell you which files
# Open the conflicted files in a text editor and resolve conflicts
# Look for lines with <<<<<<, ======, and >>>>>>
# After resolving, mark as resolved:
git add <resolved-file>

# Step 4: Complete the merge
git commit

# Step 5: Test thoroughly (see Testing Your Changes section)

# Step 6: Push to your fork
git push origin your-branch-name

# Step 7: Submit PR on GitHub
```

**Alternative:** Use the `check-upstream.sh` script in the `scripts/` directory:
```bash
# On Linux/Mac or Git Bash (Windows):
./scripts/check-upstream.sh
```

## Community
